ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:

KafkaHR Pro is a cloud-based employee management system developed as part of our Software Development and Project Management (SDPM) course at AIUB. Designed for KAFKA Private LTD, the system streamlines core HR functionalities including employee records, attendance, leave, payroll, performance reviews, and reporting through a modular and secure architecture. Our team adopted the Agile Scrum methodology to ensure iterative development, client feedback integration, and timely delivery.

The project emphasized real-world planning by incorporating stakeholder analysis, risk management, effort estimation (via COCOMO II), resource allocation, sprint scheduling, and a cost-justified implementation roadmap.

ðŸ§  What We Learned:

Through this comprehensive project, we developed both technical and managerial skills, including:


1. Agile project planning using Scrum (sprint planning, daily standups, retrospectives):

ðŸš§ Challenges We Faced:


While working on KafkaHR Pro, we encountered several real-world project challenges:

Effort Estimation Accuracy: Estimating time, cost, and resources for a full-stack HR system was complex and required iteration.

Agile Adaptation: Transitioning from theoretical Scrum understanding to practical sprint management took coordination and adjustment.

Risk Planning: Identifying and mitigating technical, financial, and security risks demanded detailed scenario analysis.

Scalability Considerations: Designing a system for high-load environments with secure integrations and compliance requirements was demanding.

Team Synchronization: Ensuring consistent contributions and documentation quality across roles (analysts, QA, devs) required structured communication.
